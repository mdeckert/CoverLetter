      <p>
         CodeGear 3rdRail is a complete, integrated development environment 
         built from the ground up to bring high efficiency coding and visualization tools to Ruby on Rails development. 
         Combining the straightforward yet powerful syntax of the Ruby language and the robust Rails framework with 
         advanced productivity tools, 3rdRail streamlines the creation of database-backed web applications while 
                 retaining the full dynamic nature of Ruby programming.     
      </p>
          
      <p> 
                 3rdRail understands how a Ruby on Rails application works and the 
                 context of what you are doing. 
                 3rdRail helps you write programs with accuracy and fewer keystrokes 
                 because you do not need to remember fine points such as object types, 
                 methods and method signatures. 
                 3rdRail predicts likely expectations based on conventions and semantics 
                 and is able to understand the context of 
                 what you are coding.     
      </p>
          
      <p>
                 Special productivity wizards combine related steps into single operations, 
                 and embedded Web development tools &#8211; 
                 including the Mozilla browser, JavaScript debugging, 
                 Document Object Model inspection and request monitoring &#8211; 
                 help you easily edit and manage all of your website artifacts.
