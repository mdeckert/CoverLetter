      <p>
         Rename View can rename a view indepently of the action 
         or it can also rename the action. 
         To rename the action as well select &#8216;Rename associated action&#8217;, 
         this is effectively Rename Action. 
             
      </p>
          
      <p>
                 If the view is a partial or there is no associated action 
                 the &#8216;Rename associated action&#8217; is disabled.
