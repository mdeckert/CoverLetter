      <p>
         Code evolves as technology and market demands evolve. 
         Over time, existing code may need to be changed to allow 
         more room to grow, to improve performance, to 
         accommodate changing needs, or simply to 
         clean up the code base. Refactoring is the 
         term used to describe the process of redesigning 
         existing code without changing its behavior from the 
                 user's point of view. 
             
      </p>
          
      <p>Refactoring may be small or extensive, 
                 but even small changes can introduce bugs. Refactoring must be 
                 done correctly and completely to be effective. One change 
                 can have permutations throughout the entire code base. 
                 Refactoring handles the entire set of permutations 
                 responsibly and durably, with safe operation, so that no 
                 behavior is changed beyond improvements in performance or maintainability.
                 
      </p>
                  
      <p>
                     Refactoring support is now expected in typed language 
                     IDEs but is not readily available in dynamic language IDEs. 
                     It is difficult to perform automated refactorings for dynamic 
                     languages since type information is not statically available. 
                     3rdRail provides refactorings by performing advanced type 
                     inference (statically analyzing a program to determine types) 
                     and semantic type inference (statically analyzing a program 
                     in the context of the specific frameworks semantics).
