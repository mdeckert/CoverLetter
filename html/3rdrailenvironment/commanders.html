      <p>The Project Commander gives you a familiar command-line interface to your Ruby on Rails project.
                 As you write and execute commands, the Project Commander shows results and hyperlinks to the files
                 created by the commands. It provides context-sensitive command, parameter, and option completion to help you execute
         commands more quickly.
             This screenshot shows Project Commander results and code completion:

      <p>
                 The Project Commander shows results of actions performed by the 3rdRail Wizards, allowing you
                 to switch between a Wizard interface and a command line interface as needed.
