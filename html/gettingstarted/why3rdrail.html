      <p>
         3rdRail can help you code faster, and better. It facilitates agile projects where  your
         ability to quickly deliver high-quality Ruby on Rails applications is the key to your success. 
                   
      </p>
          
      <ul>
                 
         <li>
                            <strong>Easily navigate to where you need to be.</strong>  
                            3rdRail helps you traverse the structure of your application. 
                            The dependencies view shows all project interdependencies. 
                            Because it understands how a Ruby on Rails application works, it allows developers to only 
                            view the area of their code relevant to a given selection.
                        
         </li>
                 
         <li>
                            <strong>Combine the power of the command line and the productivity of an IDE with CodeGear Commanders.</strong>
                            CodeGear Commanders let you dynamically switch between typing on command lines and using the IDE. 
                            For example, output from commands adding a model or view is immediately reflected throughout the IDE. 
                            Command output is hyperlinked, so you can click on any generated file or folder and it will open in the IDE.
                        
         </li>
                 
         <li>
                            <strong>Write accurate code with fewer keystrokes using intelligent code completion.</strong>
                            3rdRail provides method completion, parameter completion and syntax checking. 
                            Even methods that are created dynamically at runtime are included.
                            You no longer need to remember fine points such as object types, methods and method signatures. 
                            3rdRail predicts likely expectations based on conventions and semantics and 
                            is able to understand the context of what you are doing. 
                            Rather than simply produce a pop-up list of hundreds of choices, 3rdRail shows the correct ones. 
                        
         </li>
                 
         <li>
                            <strong>Improve and simplify application design with refactoring.</strong> 
                            The refactoring tools in 3rdRail help you reorganize your application code without changing the results.
                        
         </li>
                 
         <li>
                            <strong>Write applications using a complete Ruby on Rails runtime environment.</strong>

                            Ruby, Rails, the Gem manager and a number of special Gems and tools. 
                            Plus, you get a developer license for InterBase&reg;, CodeGear&#8217;s database for embedded and enterprise applications.

         <li>
                            <strong>Speed up development with productivity wizards.</strong>
                            3rdRail extends the power of the CodeGear Commanders with 
                            productivity wizards that combine numerous related steps into one operation.

                            JavaScript debugging, Document Object Model inspection, request monitoring and others, 
                            you can easily edit and manage all website artifacts.
