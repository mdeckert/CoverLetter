      <p>In this update of 3rdRail there have been significant changes in the following contents and features:
                   
      </p>
          
      <ul>
                 
         <li>
                            <strong>Rails 2.0:</strong>  
            Added support for creating and working with projects based on Rails 2.0.
            This support includes enhancements in the Wizards, Rails Explorer, Dependencies View, Project Commander, Code Completion,
            and Refactoring.
                        
         </li>
                 
         <li>
                            <strong>RESTful Resources:</strong>
                        Added support for creating and working with RESTful Resources in both Rails 1.2 and 2.0 projects, including a
            "New Rails Resource" wizard.
         </li>
                 
         <li>
                            <strong>Fast Debugging:</strong>
            Added support for fast, visual, debugging of Ruby and Rails projects, including support for Embedded Ruby (aka ERb, RHTML,
            HTML.ERB).
                        
         </li>
                 
         <li>
                            <strong>Code Completion:</strong>
            Added support for even more scenarios and patterns, including Sexy Migrations, Foxy Fixtures, the helper methods for Routes
            and Assertions, and more.
                        
         </li>
                 
         <li>
                            <strong>Ruby/Rails Runtime:</strong>
            Updated to include latest stable versions of Ruby, RubyGems, Rails, etc.
            Also, the latest stable versions of InterBase, MySQL, and SQLite have been included, where appropriate.
                        
         </li>
                 
         <li>
                            <strong>Rails Version Migration:</strong>
            Added support for detection and resolution of common issues when migrating an application from Rails 1.2 to 2.0.
            For instance, if your application connects to an Oracle database, 3rdRail will detect the dependency and offer a resolution
            of installing the "activerecord-oracle-adapter" gem, which isn't included in a default Rails 2.0 installation.
            Look for these messages and their associated resolution actions in the Problems View.
                        
         </li>
                 
         <li>
                            <strong>Supported Platforms:</strong>
            Added support for Mac OS X 10.5.2 (aka Leopard) and Ubuntu 7.10.
                        
         </li>
             
             
      </ul>
