      <p>
         Rename Actions understands the semantics and relationships of actions, 
         the actions associated view and logical relationships. Rename Action 
         goes beyond renaming the action, and references to the action method. 
         Rename Action also renames the associated views (.rhtml, .rxml and .rjs). 
             
      </p>
          
      <p>
                 The following list identifies the major items handled 
                 by the rename action refactoring.
