      <p>
         Rename Controller understands the semantics and 
         relationships of Controllers, Views, Helpers and Tests. 
         Rename Controller goes beyond renaming the Controller, 
         the Controller file and references to the Controller class. 
         Rename Controller also applies Rails logical relationship 
         and naming rules to the associated views, helpers, tests 
         and the view directories. 
             
      </p>
          
      <p>
                 It also handles multiple definitions 
                 of the Controller class, for instance the additional definition 
                 of the Controller class in the related functional test.
             
      </p>
          
      <p>
                 These are the major items handled by Controller refactoring:

                            Renames the associated Rails functional test class and file.
                        
         </li>
